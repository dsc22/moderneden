                        <!-- <h1>What is it that prevents us from creating a modern day Garden of Eden?</h1> -->

                        <p>Jean Jaquez Rousseau believed man was first in the wild singularly before learning he was
                            safer in groups. He illustrates in his paper, The Social Contract, the first men would have
                            lived most of our lives in solitude and rarely would have encountered other humans. Due to
                            this it was natural for us to consider ourselves and only ourselves. It was not until it
                            benefited our individual survival
                            that humans would consider socializing and serving the needs of others.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>The first step of social reason would have been something like “hey if you watch my back from
                            predators while I sleep, I’ll watch yours when you sleep” or, as Rousseau suggested, women
                            negotiated with men to hang around longer in order to protect them while they were pregnant
                            and while their children were hyper vulnerable as infants. Arguabily, this was the first
                            contract of mutual trust and foregoing competition for food,
                            territory, and resources in exchange for collaboration between humans.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Rousseau explains it likely wasn’t too long after that we began to
                            create communities of shared child rearing, allocated hunting duties, and were able to farm
                            for food. Continuing down this path eventually led to the first cities, then countries, and
                            inevitably
                            to the various complex societies we experience today.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I think we can all agree we’re no longer in fear from predators because of this. Our social
                            contracts have thankfully led to far greater sense of security and safety than our ancestors
                            could have
                            imagined; however, we are still influenced by our evolution and continue to engage in the
                            same selfish decision-making process we began with.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Richard Dawkins theory in the “Selfish Gene” is that natural selection doesn’t just select
                            the most fit or most adaptable being as Darwin proved, but consequently, and similarly to
                            Rousseau, the most selfish. Dawkins argues that focusing on itself and its needs first,
                            the self ensures its greatest chances of meeting its conditions for survival. Because they
                            are more likely to meet these conditions, the selfish are more likely to survive,
                            and therefore more selfish than selfless beings continue to pass this trait down.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It's only natural then, even within our safe and complex societies, that we continue to feel
                            this innate selfish need to protect ourselves,
                            competing for the resources we know are finite (at least in our lifespan).
                            <!--As the thought
                            goes, what happens if someone gets them first? What if others get more than us, maybe taking
                            the last of the food at the grocery store before a COVID lockdown? What if they have a
                            better paying or safer job? What if they have a bigger house and more material objects,
                            proving to be better at surviving in the modern world?</p>
                        <br> -->It’s engrained in our biology, persistently pulling at us to play the
                            game we know as “the survival of the fittest”.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Unfortunately, when we choose to play this game, we prioritize ourselves, often sacrifice
                            others
                            needs for our own inconsiderate of the bigger picture. In the confines of social
                            constructs, we exploit one another, compete for wealth, steal, occasionally
                            wage war, and other irresponsible actions; anything to be or feel like the better
                            surviving and more fit human.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the United States, a capitalist nation and where the health of the economy comes first, we
                            achieve a more favorable outcome for our business and ourselves if we
                            maximize the profit or monetary benefit of our decisions. By making decisions for profit,
                            rather than altruistically, a business can typically ensure its survival. These decisions
                            often do not demand we consider the long-term effects to
                            others whom share the same resources.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We know from scientific evidence that human agency has had a negative
                            impact our
                            planet’s vital signs. The current climate crisis, brought on by greedy
                            overconsumption, is a perfect example of this short sighted self-first nature. In our
                            near-sightedness we continue defforresation of the Amazon Rain
                            Forrest, increasingly rely on fossil fuels, and eat a
                            primarily meat diet regardless of the fact
                            we historically had primarily nut, fruit, and crop diets.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>We have the luxury, brought on by
                            societies sense of security and safety, to fill our wildest desires while ignoring the
                            harmful effects we have on ecosystems
                            of life. Ultimately, it's this selfish pattern which arises from
                            evolutionary design that has nearly ensured our own destruction and hinders us from creating
                            a Modern-Day Garden
                            of Eden. </p>

                        <br>


                        <!-- <p>If earth continues to loses fruitfulness and our finite resources
                            become more finite,
                            so will decrease each individuals’ chances for survival. Ensuring our own most
                            pleasurable survival in the near term, at all costs, has nearly ensured,
                            eventually, our own destruction.</p> -->


                        <img src="./IMG/Picture2.jpg"></img>


                        <p>I think we can all agree the current path is not a viable solution if any of us wishes to
                            survive. Instead, we need to understand ways in which
                            human agency can have a positive impact on our planets vitals. We must learn to pause,
                            resist our selfish biology, and consider what we are truly capable of before it is too late.
                            We must come to
                            perceive the
                            collectives improved survival and a plentiful
                            planet also increases our own chances of survival.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are many things we must do to overcome this. Firstly, the capitalist
                            mentality that catalyzes survival of the most profitable, must,
                            and can, find room to consider existential and altruistic issues. Thankfully,
                            it puts the power in the hands of the consumer, creating space for consumers who are willing
                            to
                            purchase altruistically and for investors willing to reevaluate what it means to be
                            the fittest company.</p>

                        <p>I hope that we can prove Einstein wrong. I hope that philosophy and reason can in fact be our
                            guide and be a beautiful sanctuary for all rather than the few.</p> -->
                        <br>
                        <p>If we want our economy to be carbon neutral, we need to do three things.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Invest in and purchase
                            only from business’ that are already or are progressing towards carbon neutrality. Those
                            that
                            recycle, produce environmentally friendly products, and who’s offerings are necessary more
                            so than desirable. By purchasing from these companies, we choose not to give our money
                            to business’ who operate in another way. We force entire industries and segments of our
                            economy, in order to gain our coin, to evolve to our green needs. And if they chose not to,
                            without revenue they will fail
                            to survive and cease to harm our planet. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Secondly, if we want our economy to limit the resources we use,
                            we could consider limiting our consumption. By purchasing less as
                            individuals, we decrease our demand for products. In the grand scheme of things, decreased
                            demand means
                            decreased supply (output) which necessitates less (input) resources.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Lastly, if we truly desire to manifest a more plentiful earth, we can donate our wealth to
                            non-profits and
                            organizations that are devoted to clean energy technology, restoring fertility in the soil,
                            planting greenery, and reviving healthy populations of wildlife. If we're short on money, we
                            can write our
                            local
                            representatives to
                            encourage government programs that benefit these organizations.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ultimately, to change our reality all we need to do is change our mindset.</p>

                        <img src="./IMG/Picture5.jpg"></img>



                        <p>Thousands of years ago it was written in the Bible,</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish
                            of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the
                            earth” [Genesis 1:26-28.]</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We’ve allowed this mentality to influence Western human behavior for thousands of years.
                            We’ve selfishly assumed dominion gives us the right to dominate like a dictator. To rule
                            over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and every living thing that moves upon the
                            earth in the way we see fit and pleases our desires.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It's time we viewed this in a healthier way. Rather than have “dominion” over all living
                            things, we can rule more like a philosopher. As Merriam-Webster defines it, “one who studies
                            the fundamental nature of
                            knowledge, reality, and existence”; an expert on making
                            more responsible decisions for all of reality and existence that moves upon the
                            earth. In a sense, we can identify as stewards of this planet; something civilizations of
                            the past have already achieved before us.</p>

                        <img src="./IMG/Picture6.jpg"></img>



                        <!-- <p>Since this leaves the rest of us non-kings or
                            non-leading humans without a new identity; it may be better for
                            the common man to view ourselves as the collective stewards of this planet, an idea that has
                            gained recognition in recent years.
                        <br>
                        <p>According to Merriam-Webster's dictionary, a steward, is “a person who looks after the
                            passengers on a ship, aircraft, or train and brings them meals.” </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>By identifying as stewards of earth, we take on a supporting role for all lifeforms. We
                            identify as a people who looks after the passengers (i.e. life) on earth and one who
                            provides for them.</p>
                        <br> -->
                        <p>If we can do this we’re capable of overcoming our selfish nature and enabling
                            a greater degree of well-being for all. We can leave this planet more pletiful than we found
                            it.
                            In a nutshell, we’re capable of overcoming our hinderance and we're capable of creating A
                            Modern Day Eden.</p>
