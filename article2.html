                        <!-- <h1>What is it that prevents us from creating a modern day Garden of Eden?</h1> -->

                        <p>Jean Jaquez Rousseau believed man was first in the wild singularly before learning he was
                            safer in groups. He illustrates in his paper, The Social Contract, that our first instinct
                            is to consider ourselves and only ourselves. It was not until it became in our self interest
                            that humans began to socialize positively and consider others.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>The first step of social reason would have been something like “hey if you watch my back from
                            predators while I sleep, I’ll watch yours when you sleep” or, as Rousseau suggested, women
                            negotiated with men to hang around longer in order to protect them while they were pregnant
                            and while their children were hyper vulnerable as infants. This would have been the first
                            contract to mutual trust and foregoing competition for food,
                            territory, and resources in exchange for collaboration between humans.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Rousseau explains it likely wasn’t too long after this that we began to
                            create communities of shared child rearing, allocated hunting duties, and were able to farm
                            for food. Continuing down this path led to the first cities, then countries, and inevitably
                            to the various complex societies we experience today.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Sure, we’re no longer in fear from bears and lions because of this. After all, our social
                            contracts have led to far greater sense of security and safety than our ancestors could have
                            imagined; however, we are still influenced by our evolution and continue to engage in the
                            same selfish decision-making process.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Richard Dawkins theory in the “Selfish Gene” is that natural selection doesn’t just select
                            the most fit or most adaptable being as Darwin proved, but consequently, and similarly to
                            Rousseau, the most selfish. Dawkins argues that by focusing on itself and its needs first,
                            the self ensures its greatest chances of meeting its own conditions for survival. As a
                            result of the more selfish beings meeting their conditions for survival, the selfish survive
                            and continue to pass this trait down.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Even within our safe and complex societies, we continue to feel this innate selfish need to
                            compete for the resources we know are finite (at least in our lifespan).
                            <!--As the thought
                            goes, what happens if someone gets them first? What if others get more than us, maybe taking
                            the last of the food at the grocery store before a COVID lockdown? What if they have a
                            better paying or safer job? What if they have a bigger house and more material objects,
                            proving to be better at surviving in the modern world?</p>
                        <br> -->It’s unfortunately engrained in our biology and consistenly pulls at us to play the
                            game we know as “the survival of the fittest”.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>When we choose to play this game, we prioritize ourselves, often choosing to sacrifice others
                            needs for our own and inconsiderate of the bigger picture. In the confines of social
                            constructs, we exploit one another, compete for wealth, occasionally
                            wage war, and many other irresponsible actions; anything to be or feel like the better
                            surviving and more fit human. The current climate crisis, brought on by
                            our selfish overconsumption, is a perfect example of our short sighted self-first nature.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the United States, a capitalist nation and where the health of the economy comes first, we
                            often can achieve a more favorable outcome for our business and ourselves if we
                            maximize the profit or monetary benefit of our decisions. Even if it means
                            cutting wages, decreasing the nutrients in our food, or increasing the quantity of output
                            to benefit from scale, the business can typically ensure
                            its survival. These decisions do not require us to consider the long-term effects to other
                            industries, countries, ecosystems, and species that share the resources we will leverage or
                            produce.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As we understand from scientific evidence, human agency has had a negative impact our
                            planet’s vital signs. In our near-sightedness we cut down more of
                            the Amazon Rain Forrest, buy a massive gas guzzling truck or sports car, and to continue a
                            primarily meat diet regardless of the fact
                            we historically had primarily nut, fruit, and crop diets. We have the luxury, brought on by
                            societies sense of security and safety, to ignore the harmful effects each of these
                            decisions has on ecosystems of life.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Unfortunately, our insistance that we achieve
                            our own most
                            pleasurable survival in the near term, at all costs, has nearly ensured our own
                            destruction. Ultimately, this selfish desire which arises from
                            evolutionary design is
                            what hinders us from creating a Modern-Day Garden of Eden. </p>

                        <!-- <p>If earth continues to loses fruitfulness and our finite resources
                            become more finite,
                            so will decrease each individuals’ chances for survival. Ensuring our own most
                            pleasurable survival in the near term, at all costs, has nearly ensured,
                            eventually, our own destruction.</p> -->


                        <img src="./IMG/Picture2.jpg"></img>


                        <p>Instead of the current path, we can use reason to understand ways in which
                            human agency would have a positive impact on our planets vitals. We must learn to pause,
                            resist our selfish biology, and consider what we are truly capable of. We must come to
                            understand the
                            collectives improved survival and a plentiful
                            planet also ensures our own improved survival.</p>




                        <br>


                        <p>The capitalist mentality that catalyzes survival of the most profitable (i.e. fittest), must,
                            and can, find room to consider existential and altruistic issues. Gratefully,
                            capitalism puts the power in the hands of the consumer.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>When consumers are willing to
                            purchase altruistically and investors reevaluate what it means to be
                            the fittest company (i.e. more altruistic business’), we will
                            inevitably and exponentially change the world for the better. I dare say it will be the
                            first step towards creating a Utopian, heaven on earth, environment. A Modern Day Eden</p>

                        <p>I hope that we can prove Einstein wrong. I hope that philosophy and reason can in fact be our
                            guide and be a beautiful sanctuary for all rather than the few.</p> -->
                        <br>
                        <p>If we want our economy to be carbon neutral, all we need to do is invest in and purchase
                            from business’ that are already or are progressing towards carbon neutrality. Those that
                            recycle, produce environmentally friendly products, and who’s offerings are necessary more
                            so than desirable. By purchasing from these companies only, we choose not to give our money
                            to business’ who operate in another way. We force entire industries and segments of our
                            economy to, in order to gain our coin, evolve to our green needs. If they chose not to,
                            without revenue they will fail
                            to survive and cease to harm our planet. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If we want our economy to limit the resources we use,
                            we could consider limiting our consumption. By purchasing less as
                            individuals, we decrease our demand for products. In the grand scheme of things, a decrease
                            in demand results in a decrease in supply, which demands less input resources.</p>
                        <br>
                        If we desire to manifest a more plentiful earth, we can donate our wealth to non-profits and
                        organizations that go to restoring fertility in the soil,
                        greenery, and healthy populations of wildlife. If we're short on money, we can write our local
                        representatives to
                        encourage government programs that benefit these organizations.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ultimately, to change our reality all we need to do is change our mindset.</p>

                        <img src="./IMG/Picture5.jpg"></img>



                        <p>Thousands of years ago it was written in the Bible,</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish
                            of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the
                            earth” [Genesis 1:26-28.]</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We’ve allowed this mentality to influence Western human behavior for thousands of years.
                            We’ve selfishly assumed dominion gives us the right to dominate like a dictator. To rule
                            over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and every living thing that moves upon the
                            earth in the way we see fit and in the way that pleases our desires.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It's time we viewed this in a healthier way. Rather than have “dominion” over all living
                            things, we can rule more like a philosopher. As Merriam-Webster defines it, “one who studies
                            the fundamental nature of
                            knowledge, reality, and existence”; an expert in using reason for the purpose of making
                            wiser, more responsible decisions for all of reality and existence that moves upon the
                            earth.</p>

                        <img src="./IMG/Picture6.jpg"></img>



                        <!-- <p>Since this leaves the rest of us non-kings or
                            non-leading humans without a new identity; it may be better for
                            the common man to view ourselves as the collective stewards of this planet, an idea that has
                            gained recognition in recent years.
                        <br>
                        <p>According to Merriam-Webster's dictionary, a steward, is “a person who looks after the
                            passengers on a ship, aircraft, or train and brings them meals.” </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>By identifying as stewards of earth, we take on a supporting role for all lifeforms. We
                            identify as a people who looks after the passengers (i.e. life) on earth and one who
                            provides for them.</p>
                        <br> -->
                        <p>Using reason virtuously, we’re capable of overcoming our selfish nature tin order to
                            enable
                            a greater level of well-being of all. To leave this planet more pletiful than we found it.
                            In a nutshell, we’re capable of overcoming our hinderance
                            to creating A Modern Day Eden.</p>
