                            take care of
                            it.
                            16 And the Lord God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;
                            17 but
                            you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it
                            you will certainly die.”</p>
                        <p class="center">~Genesis: 1: 15-17</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>As far as we know, the above passage is the first time the Garden of Eden is mentioned in
                            human
                            history. Religious or not, we can all mostly agree on that.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The premise of the Garden is
                            this; it is on earth, plentiful and abundant in food, greenery, life and essentially has
                            anything man could ever need within in boundaries. Oh and at its center is the tree of
                            knowledge
                            of good and evil, which man should not eat from.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Historically speaking, we can understand that
                            whoever wrote this believed humans originated from a single location.</p>
                        <br>
                        <P>It was upon eating from
                            the tree of knowledge at this single location, analogous to obtaining knowledge and/or
                            consciousness, that man became aware he could die.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>From there, humanity would go on to engage in
                            more evil deeds, straying further and further from its duty to take care for Eden as we
                            attempted to evade death out of fear. Also known as the root of all evil.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Biblically speaking, from the moment Adam and
                            Eve ate from the tree of knowledge, disobeying God in the process, humanity became sinful,
                            was
                            cast out, and determined to no longer be worthy of the Garden of Eden.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I whole heartedly
                            disagree with this.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In fact, while I respect the Bible and have gained wisdom from its teachings, I think we’re
                            uniquely capable,
                            especially modern humans, of creating the Garden of Eden yet again.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We may have
                            knowledge of good and evil, which may result in us acting evil or sinful, but it also means
                            we
                            can choose to act on what we believe to be good.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Garden of Eden does not necessarily have to
                            be a single Garden in-between four rivers with a magic tree at its center.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Garden of Eden
                            can be Earth itself and humanity can once again devout ourselves to taking care of it. We
                            can
                            choose to enhance our knowledge of the natural world, to heal forests, deserts, ocean reefs,
                            and
                            near extinct populations.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>At our center, spiritually more-so rather than physically, knowledge
                            and reason (i.e. the tree) can connect us. The fruits of knowledge we’ve gained in our
                            pursuits of sciences, art, history, and many other forms can inform our decisions for the
                            long
                            term health of our planet its inhabitants.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We can continue developing our technology and
                            creating more advanced clean energy and sustainable solutions. Until one day; we create a
                            lush,
                            vibrant, and abundant earth.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>An earth so sustainable that each day, rather than gradually turn
                            to desert, it becomes greener and even more diverse in life. This would be what I call like
                            to
                            call Modern Day Eden. </p>
